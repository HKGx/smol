A programming language

# Examples
## Hello, World!
```fs
print("Hello, World!")
```
## 99 Bottles of Beer
```fs
for bottles in 100..1..-1 do 
    print(str(bottles) + " bottles of bear on the wall, " + str(bottles) + " bottles of beer")
    plural := 
        if bottles == 2:
            "bottle"
        else:
            "bottles"
    print("Take one down and pass it around, " + str(bottles - 1) + " " + plural + " of bear on the wall")
end

print("1 bottle of beer on the wall, 1 bottle of beer")
print("Take one down and pass it around, no bottles of bear on the wall")
```
