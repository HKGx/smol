A programming language

## Our goals
They're yet to be reached, be patient! ฅ^•ﻌ•^ฅ
- [ ] uncluttered syntax
- [ ] high readability
- [ ] expressivenes
- [ ] type safety
- [ ] helpful errors
  

Syntax is still under heated debate, it'll take time to settle on one thing

Currently, we're dynamically and strongly typed, but it shall soon change as we add compile-time (parse-time?) type-checking.
